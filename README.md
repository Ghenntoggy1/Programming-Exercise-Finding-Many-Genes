PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Finding Many Genes"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use of String type of variables;
                    Part 1 - Find a gene in a strand of DNA where the stop codon could be any of the three stop codons “TAA”, “TAG”, or “TGA”.
                    Find all the genes (where the stop codon could be any of the three stop codons) in a strand of DNA.
                    Part 2 - Determine how many occurrences of a string appear in another string.
                    Part 3 - Count how many genes are in a strand of DNA.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". Find inside of this project 3 classes: 
                           Part 1 - compile, create object of type Part1 and start function "testFindStopCodon" or "test"; 
                           Part 2 - compile, create object of type Part2 and start function "test" and follow instructions on screen; 
                           Part 3 - compile, create object of type Part3 and start function "testCountGenes".
